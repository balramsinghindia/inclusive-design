# Inclusive Design

Every design decision includes or excludes certain range of user groups. Inclusive Design is an approach that emphasis on including full range of humans diversity. It is about involving and learning from users having different range of perspective and delivering outstanding user experience to as many users as possible. 

The impact of inclusive design is more than just the products that people use. Itâ€™s also a shift in our mindset, methods, and behaviours. What we design is a byproduct of how we design. Measuring the benefits includes measuring the shift in our culture and ourselves.

In this talk I will explain how Inclusive Design can help in increased access, reduced friction and more emotional context of product to end user. 

In Australia, over 70% of people have some level of difficulty or frustration in using digital products and services. Inclusive design is understanding them and delivering them best in class user experience.
